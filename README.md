# Overview
**Maps SDK, a Microsoft Garage project** provides the ability to visualize a 3D map within Unity-based projects. The SDK handles streaming and rendering of 3D terrain data with world-wide coverage.

Select cities and regions are rendered at a very high level of detail.

Maps SDK, a Microsoft Garage project has been optimized for mixed reality applications and devices including the HoloLens, HoloLens 2, Windows Immersive headsets, HTC Vive, and Oculus Rift.

The SDK also provides APIs for services like geocoding as well as utility classes for working with geospatial data.

See [Microsoft® Bing™ Map Platform APIs Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/maps/product/terms.html) for information about the terms of use for the SDK.

# Getting started

For instructions to download and setup the control, check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Unity/wiki/Getting-Started) page on the wiki.

The wiki also contains documentation, an API reference, and an in-depth overview of the sample scene.

# What is in this repo?

The core source code for the control is not part of this repository. The binary is available via a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Maps.Unity). See [Microsoft® Bing™ Map Platform APIs Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/maps/product/terms.html) for information about the terms of use.

This repository includes **samples**, **documentation** and **supporting scripts**.

The **supporting scripts** are Unity C# scripts that extend or build on-top of the SDK. Because of their usefulness, these supporting scripts are also included in the NuGet package. The version of the supporting scripts in the repository reflects the latest version of the scripts in the NuGet package.

Contributions to the supporting scripts are welcome, and approved changes will be folded back into the NuGet package. Refer to the [Contribution Process](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
